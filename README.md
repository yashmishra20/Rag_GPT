## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI model that combines information retrieval with text generation. It enhances the capabilities of large language models by allowing them to access and utilize external knowledge bases. In our application, RAG enables more accurate and context-aware responses when chatting with PDF content.
